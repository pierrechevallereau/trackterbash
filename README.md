# trackterbash
 

trackterbash is a bash library designed to trap/tag/color errors and stop smoothly the main process. 

By default,
  - errors are surrounded with red color
  - the main process is stopped on error
  - the ctrl+c maccro is trapped and you can do something on occur

### Available options :

```
ðŸŒµ ./trackterbash --help
--no-exit                 : don't stop the main process on error
--exit-function='_exit'   : change exit function when --no-exit is not used
    Extra doc {
      With --exit-function=* option, you can use your own exit function to properly exit when an error occur,
      to limit errors, please set up your own function before source trackterbash.sh 

      Use cases:
        - you have created a temp file and you want to delete it before exit
        - you use a ssh tunnel and you want to kill it before exit
      
      Default function :
      _exit()
      {
        sleep 0.15 # little sleep time to prevent disordered log
        echo 'Exit due to an error'
        exit 1
      }

    }
--no-ctrlc                : don't trap ctrl+c SIGINT
--ctrlc-function='_ctrlc' : change ctrl+c function when --no-ctrlc is not used
    Extra doc {
      With --ctrlc-function=* option, you can use your own function to properly exit when Ctrl+C occur,
      to limit errors, please set up your own function before source trackterbash.sh 

      Use cases:
